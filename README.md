## My process

### Built with

- Plain HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

- plan out the layout before your start
- use more divs to group things together even if they're not necessarily visualy related
- finish the entire layout first before focusing on one perticular part

### Useful resources

- [The tutorial I followed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8) - I found the tutorial by Kevin Powell before I found the challenge itself, so for this time I figured I'd follow along with him instead of trying myself. it was very insightfull though I'll obviously be completing the other challenges myself.
